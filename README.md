# challenge2
## Description

- My motivation towards completing this project was in wanting to build a webpage entirely from scratch for the first time, and seeing how well I could get it to look/function.
- I built this project to obtain experience in something I was already familiar with, but without the familiar building blocks that are often given to me.
- The problem solved within the challenge was building a functioning portfolio in the sense of functioning links, functional page resizing, and a format that follows the given acceptance criteria.
- I learned how to build a website from scratch! I tried my best with the design, but the biggest priority was getting the webpage to function properly while giving it a digestible pallet.

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

## Installation

1. Created repository on GitHub.com and cloned repository locally to desktop.
2. Created touch.html and created script for the entirety of HTML first to make sure functionality was in check before working on design.
3. Created style.css and designed general fonts and additonal functionalities pertaining to web page's design.
4. Pushed local changes back to main branch on original GitHub repository (via GitHub.com), and deployed code at live URL.


## Usage

Open the provided URL on your desired browser to access the portfolio. Links in the "header" column will direct you to corresponding label inside the webpage. Pictures can be clicked on in order to reach repository represented on the page. In the footer, additional links will direct you to specific bits of my info/contact info.
